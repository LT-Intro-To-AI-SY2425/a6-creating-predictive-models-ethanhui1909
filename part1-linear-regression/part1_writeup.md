# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?

The r squared value according to the model was 0.62. This implies that there is a relatively strong correlation between age and blood pressure.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?

According to my model, the predicted systolic blood pressure for someone that is 42 years old is 136.52. 

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?

This model's predicitions are relatively accurate, as the linear regression model accurately follows a general trend between age and blood pressure, but there are signifcant amount of outlying data that makes this model slightly inaccurate. This model could be improved with a greater dataset, which would account for the outlying data.
