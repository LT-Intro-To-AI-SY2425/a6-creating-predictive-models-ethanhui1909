## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.
Top Left: Fiscal Mismanagement -> spends too much money despite a lack of supporting annual income, therefore their finanical management is completely off-balance
Top Right: baller -> has enough money to support their finanical escapades, thus granting them this category
Middle: Finanically Balanced -> perfectly in the middle
Bottom Left: Significant cutback -> doesn't spend anything because they don't have anything to spend
Bottom Right: Finanically Careful -> Despite having a more than stable income, their spending habits are more than frugal.
2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
Bottom Right (Finanically Careful) or Middle (Finanically Balanced)

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?
baller -> marketing team can approach this specific group by appealing to this customer group's needs without having to account for finanical setbacks.
